# J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor)

A javascript text editor that runs in-browser! Furthermore, this application is a PWA (Progressive Web App) or an
application built with web-based technologies that can be installed on a computer and run even without internet.

State is cached and retrieved thanks to indexDb. Callbacks are fired upon any page update therefore typed-in text is
guaranteed to be retrievable. 

This text editor is batteries-included and the only thing to do to install the PWA is to press the install button
and confirm at the prompt. Easy!
